// Write your Character component here

//me: so this will be the layout of the INFO that's INSIDE the each box (which could be another component, but I put it inside the App component -- which could've just been for an outline of the page -- .map in App.js then). display names and other character info with props. style in App, above the comp function


import React from "react";
//import from reactstrap for styling... 

export default function Character({characters}){
    return "hello"

};
